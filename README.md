# Clarification of Supplementary Materials for Submission 15694: VidTwin

We have included a PDF appendix and generated videos as part of our supplementary materials. Additionally, we **strongly recommend that readers explore the results through `index.html`**, which can be opened in a web browser.

The following is an overview of the contents and organization of the supplementary files:

- **`Appendix.pdf`**: Provides additional details on experimental results and implementation aspects that were not covered in the main text.
- **`video/cross/`**: Contains results from our cross-reenactment experiments.
- **`video/disen/`**: Showcases the outcomes of our decoupling reconstruction experiments.
- **`video/recon/`** and **`video/recon_baselines/`**: Include video reconstruction results, comparing our model's performance with baseline methods.

Once again, we encourage you to visit the local website `index.html` for a more user-friendly exploration of the results and annotations.

Thank you for reviewing our materials, and we wish you a pleasant experience!
